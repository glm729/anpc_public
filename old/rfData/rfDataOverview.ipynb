    "The critical outcomes of these operations are the restructuring or reformatting of KEGG Compound data, as retrieved from the KEGG REST API via the `KEGGREST` package (via BioConductor) in *R*.  The input in most cases is and RData object containing data for 8810 compounds, as provided in KEGG Compound via `KEGGREST`, but other operations to reformat or query the KEGG Compound data with specific regard to the literature data will also make direct use of the recorded data from literature.\n"

    "This notebook describes the scripts used to reformat the spreadsheet containing the information entered given a literature search.  The main purpose of reformatting these data is to reduce the information to a certain set of variables, such as name, regulation direction, and DOI in which the data are found.  This is to allow for faster retrieval/traversal of commonly used data, and generally to allow querying or reading in languages other than *R*.\n"
