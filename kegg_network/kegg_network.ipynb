    "\n",
    "##### Task\n",
    "\n",
    "The task was to build a network of compounds, as listed in KEGG, using the [KEGGREST package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/KEGGREST.html) in *R*;\n",
    "- Given a set of reactions, extract all compounds.\n",
    "- Draw arc between compounds whereby one compound opposes the other in the reaction.\n",
    "  - That is, if the compound is on the opposite side of the reaction equation, an arc is drawn.\n",
    "- An extension of a previous task, whereby all reactions are extracted from a given organism ID (see [`kegg_hsa_reactions`](https://github.com/glm729/anpc_public/blob/master/kegg_hsa_get_reactions/kegg_hsa_get_reactions.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Progress\n",
    "- Completed main functions for requesting reaction data, extracting a list of opposing compounds, building an adjacency list, and building an adjacency matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Notes and comments\n",
    "- The main *R* functions were produced for previous work, but have been documented and adapted for this task.\n",
    "- The function `split_to_n` has been documented previously, and is not documented here."
