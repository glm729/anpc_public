# ANPC Public

Work completed for the ANPC, available for public view.

The primary purpose is to allow greater visibility to other members of the ANPC,
without requiring individual login and access, but also improves collaboration
capability.

Further, considering most work is completed using open-source technologies, it
was thought that the resulting code could be made visible to the public.
