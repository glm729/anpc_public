# ANPC -- Public
#### Mr. George L. Malone
#### Last update:  19<sup>th</sup> of May, 2021

Work completed for the Australian National Phenome Centre, Murdoch University,
available to public view.

The primary purpose of this repository is to allow better version control, and
permits greater visibility to other members of the ANPC without requiring
individual login and access, but also improves potential collaboration
capability.  Further, considering most work is completed using open-source
technologies, it was thought that the resulting code could be made visible to
the public.  Confidential or sensitive data will be masked or deleted before
release, but it is likely that most scripts will be unmodified unless there are
specific hardcoded data that are considered confidential or sensitive.

The structure should approximately reflect the project structure -- each
directory is a project, and the contents therein are the relative requirements
for running the operations therein, with the probable exception of the data.
