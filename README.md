## ANPC -- Public

Work completed for the Australian National Phenome Centre, Murdoch University,
available to public view.

**NOTE:  The D3 visualisation project has now been moved into [its own
repository](https://github.com/glm729/d3fdg/), thus any development of this
project will no longer be reflected in the `./d3test` directory.**

The primary purpose of this repository is to allow better version control, and
greater visibility to other members of the ANPC without requiring individual
login and access, but also improves potential collaboration capability.
Further, considering most work is completed using open-source technologies, it
was thought that the resulting code could be made visible to the public.
Confidential or sensitive data will be masked or deleted before release, but it
is likely that most scripts will be unmodified unless there are specific
hardcoded data that are considered confidential or sensitive.

Current work focuses on working with literature search results, and with data
available from the KEGG database via the KEGG REST API, to produce a
visualisation of associated metabolites under certain disease statuses.  This
is currently being developed for use in the web-based ChemInfo system, thus
most scripts produced recently are written in JavaScript.  This project has now
been moved to its own repository -- see
[glm729/d3fdg](https://github.com/glm729/d3fdg/).
