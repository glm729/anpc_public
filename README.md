## ANPC -- Public

Work completed for the Australian National Phenome Centre, Murdoch University,
available to public view.

The primary purpose is to allow better version control, and greater visibility
to other members of the ANPC without requiring individual login and access, but
also improves potential collaboration capability.  Further, considering most
work is completed using open-source technologies, it was thought that the
resulting code could be made visible to the public.  Confidential or sensitive
data will be masked or deleted before release, but it is likely that most
scripts will be unmodified unless there are specific hardcoded data that are
considered confidential or sensitive.

Current work focuses on working with literature search results, and with data
available from the KEGG database via the KEGG REST API, to produce a
visualisation of associated metabolites under certain disease statuses.  This
is currently being developed for use in the web-based ChemInfo system, thus
most scripts produced recently are written in JavaScript.
