#  Overview

This report aims to provide some numerical summaries of data stratification by
taxonomy, as presented by the [Human Metabolome Database (HMDB)][1].  Firstly,
each main taxonomical category is provided, with the number of different levels
within each category.  Secondly, within the superclass category, the
distribution of entries in each level is examined.


# Data

The data used for this investigation are the set of all XML-formatted data for
each HMDB metabolite, as extracted from the overall HMDB metabolites XML.  The
process by which the [HMDB _All Metabolites_ XML][2] was split is detailed
[here][3].  There are a total of 114,222 files to consider.

## Target data

The information of interest is held by five different sections (keys) within
the data.  The keys are `direct_parent`, `kingdom`, `super_class`, `class`, and
`sub_class`.  A sixth key, `molecular_framework`, was previously considered but
found to vary in depth and complexity between HMDB entries, thus no direct
translation between metabolites could be made.


# Results

## Overall taxonomical groups

The maximum number of entries featuring a direct parent, kingdom, and
superclass entry was 114,133, suggesting that 89 entries lack complete
taxonomical information.  Otherwise, 114,091 entries feature a class attribute,
and 109,883 entries feature a subclass attribute.  A tabular summary is
provided in Table \ref{table:keypresence}.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \texttt{direct\_parent} & 114,133\\
    \texttt{kingdom} & 114,133\\
    \texttt{super\_class} & 114,133\\
    \texttt{class} & 114,091\\
    \texttt{sub\_class} & 109,883\\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{
    \label{table:keypresence}
    Number of entries featuring taxonomical key.
  }
\end{table}

## Number of subgroups

Within each major taxonomical group, the least number of unique subgroups was
2, and the most number of unique subgroups was 1,526.  A tabular summary is
provided in Table \ref{table:subgroups}.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \texttt{direct\_parent} & 1,526\\
    \texttt{sub\_class} & 527\\
    \texttt{class} & 327\\
    \texttt{super\_class} & 25\\
    \texttt{kingdom} & 2\\
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{
    \label{table:subgroups}
    Number of unique subgroup keys per major taxonomical group.
  }
\end{table}

## Number within subgroups

A full summary of the numbers within each subgroup is provided separately in
YAML and TSV formats, as it is too large to present in this report.  Of
particular interest, the superclass "Lipids and lipid-like molecules" contains
90,688 of the 114,222 HMDB entries, that is, 62.9% of the entire database.
