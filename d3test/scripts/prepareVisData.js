/**
 * Function for preparing a set of data for the D3 force-directed graph (fdg).
 * Assumes `oppose` is from the `reduceOppose` function.  Checks which nodes
 * have already been seen, to avoid defining multiple of the same node.
 * Replaces IDs with the names of the compounds.
 *
 * TODO:  Check why some compounds still feature IDs, and do not appear to
 *        feature a name (=> if statements in withId.map not working).
 *
 * @param {Array} withId Data from the literature with ID(s) in KEGG Compound.
 * @param {Array} oppose Array of objects of opposing compounds, based on the
 * KEGG Reaction equations.
 * @return {Object} Required data for D3 fdg, containing the arrays `nodes` and
 * `links`, defining the graph visualisation.
