    "\n",
    "##### Task\n",
    "The task was to collect all reactions associated with the H. sapiens system. The method required was to imitate the route used by the MATLAB package [MetaboNetworks](https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/42684-metabonetworks), but implemented in *R*, using the [`KEGGREST` package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/KEGGREST.html);\n",
    "- Given an organism ID;\n",
    "  1. Extract all enzymes.\n",
    "  2. Extract all reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Progress\n",
    "In its current state, the *R* functions are able to;\n",
    "- extract all enzymes given an organism ID\n",
    "- extract all associated reactions\n",
    "- return a sorted list of unique reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Notes and comments\n",
    "- `roxygen2`-style documentation is included for each function definition.\n",
    "- `split_to_n` has been mildly updated from its original state for inclusion in this document.\n",
    "- The cause of greatest computation time appears to be the function `get_enzymedetails_from_enzymelist`, as it's making a large number of requests to KEGG.\n",
    "- The output of this set of functions could be sent to functions created previously, such that all compounds can be extracted from the list of reactions.\n",
    "  - In essence, these functions theoretically provide a more comprehensive method to collect data on all reactions relating to the H. sapiens metabolism.\n",
    "- The operations have not been tested on the entire enzyme list, only on a non-random sample of 40."
